## Servos

### Shoulder

When the upper leg is pointing straight down from the shoulder the servo is at
45 degrees of rotation. This is because the knee points backwards. More rotation
is needed behind the center line than in front.

### Knee

When the upper and lower leg are straight, the servo is at 180 degrees.
